### Made by

## Obejective of assignment: 
Students will build a simple REST API, implement tests for its endpoints, ensure code 
coverage, and conduct basic performance testing. This will involve using tools like 
HTTP files, Rest Clients, and JMeter (or similar). Additionally, students will perform 
basic benchmarking of their APIâ€™s performance.

## Deliverables: 

### Source code for REST API


### Unit tests, integration tests and HTTP test files

### Code coverage report, minimum 80% coverage

### JMeter Test plan and load rest results

### Reflection page

### Test plan
